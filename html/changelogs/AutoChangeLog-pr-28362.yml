changes: 
  - tweak: "Spotlight frames are now constructable with 3 steel sheets. (For those who don't know: spotlights are light fixtures specialized for large tubes, which shed more light. They're generally found in places like the Galley, with large open spaces.)"
  - tweak: "Light replacers now destroy broken bulbs when used by cyborgs."
  - tweak: "When held in-hand, you can see if a light tube is rigged to explode by examining it."
  - tweak: "Removing light fixtures from walls now operates at a speed determined by construction skill."
  - bugfix: "You can no longer inject an infinite amount of reagents into light tubes."
  - bugfix: "Light tubes no longer suck all reagents out of a syringe, and instead only remove the necessary phoron to rig them to explode."
  - bugfix: "Unscrewing an empty light tube will no longer delete its wires."
